jMetro! A Windows 8/8.1 UI Modal Alert plugin.

This jQuery plugin was based on the <b>Windows 8/8.1 User Interface</b> (before: "Metro UI"),
						   since there is <a href="http://metroui.org.ua/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some plugins</a> and CSS for block' styles similar to Start UI Interface, but 
					nothing about the modal alert.</p>
						<p>There is some usage examples on the folder "<a href="http://bluebeta.studio/plugins/jmetro/"><b>DEMO</b></a>", it includes how I made the MIT License' modal (the one you used for download this) and more.
